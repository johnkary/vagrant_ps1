# Vagrant PS1

Provides visual feedback if a Vagrant virtual machine has been launched from
the current working directory.

When properly configured you should see a green â€£ in your PS1:

## Requirements

* `php` binary must be available in your $PATH to execute script that
  compares current dir VM to running VMs

## Installation

1. Clone directory to your `~/.vagrant.d` directory:
```
git clone git@github.com/johnkary/vagrant_ps1.git ~/.vagrant.d/
```

2. Source the `dir.sh` file in this repository into your `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
source ~/.vagrant.d/vagrant_ps1/dir.sh
```

3. From your `~/.bash_profile`, add the bash function `\$(__vagrant_dir)` to
  your PS1 where you'd like the indicator to appear. This example would prepend
  it to your current PS1:
```bash
export PS1="\$(__vagrant_dir)$PS1"
```

4. Open a new bash session or source your `~/.bash_profile`:
```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

## TODO

* Port current PHP script to Ruby so an additional binary is not needed.
  Vagrant already needs `ruby` to run, so the script that checks for it
  should also be written in that language.
